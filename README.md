## Install

### Docker

The following command will build the project, pull images and start containers with default settings.

In your terminal (in the root project folder):

```bash
docker/run
```
Note: You can build the project with maven in a containerized environ by commenting the line 14 and uncommenting the line 15 in the `docker/run` file.
If you don't have the right to launch `docker/run` try :

```bash
chmod +x docker/run
```
and try again.

### Manually

1. Download the latest [Hazelcast exporter JAR](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-hazelcast-exporter/releases)

2. Copy the JAR into the broker folder `~/zeebe-broker-%{VERSION}/lib`

3. Add the exporter to the broker configuration `~/zeebe-broker-%{VERSION}/config/zeebe.cfg.toml`.
    ```
    [[exporters]]
    id = "hazelcast"
    className = "io.zeebe.hazelcast.exporter.HazelcastExporter"
    
      [exporters.args]
      # comma separated list of io.zeebe.protocol.record.ValueType
      enabledValueTypes = "JOB,WORKFLOW_INSTANCE,DEPLOYMENT,INCIDENT,TIMER,VARIABLE,MESSAGE,MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION,MESSAGE_START_EVENT_SUBSCRIPTION"
    
      # If true, the exporter update its position after publish the record to Hazelcast.
      # Otherwise, it never update its position. On broker start, it will always start from the begin of the log. 
      # CAUTION! The broker can't delete data and may run out of disk space if set to false. 
      updatePosition = false
    ```

4. Start the broker
    
5. Download the latest [application JAR](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-simple-monitor/releases)    

6. Start the application
    `java -jar zeebe-simple-monitor-app-{VERSION}.jar`

7. Go to http://localhost:8080
