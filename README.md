Zeebe Simple Monitor
=========================

A monitoring application for [Zeebe](https://zeebe.io). It is designed for developers to

* get in touch with Zeebe and workflow execution (BPMN)
* test workflows manually
* provide insides how workflows are executed 

The application imports the data from Zeebe using the [Hazelcast exporter](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-hazelcast-exporter). It aggregates the data and store it into a (in-memory) database. The data is display on server-side rendered HTML pages.
